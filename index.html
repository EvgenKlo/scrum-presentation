					<section>Scrum technology is suitable for the rapid development of new products. It allows you to combine specialists from different departments into one team and set a common goal for them. Progress in the group is faster due to well-established interaction, a small number of participants and a common interest in performance.</section>
					<section>Scrum is a project management method for companies where there are opportunities and resources for experimentation. If everything goes strictly according to plan, there is a clear deadline and budget, Scrum loses its meaning.</section>
					<section>Another detail, without which it is impossible to fully use the method, is the willingness of the customer to take part in the development. Not everyone is interested in this and can find the time.</section>
